# Development-of-a-Colour-Normalization-and-Segmentation-System-for-Malaria-Slide-Images
A GUI system that can implement color normalization for minimizing cell staining variation on malaria slide images as well as an image segmentation method on the malaria slide images to separate the infected cells from the non-infected ones using a deep learning approach. The image segmentation technique that was utilized was semantic segmentation using the MATLAB application.
